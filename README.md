This lab focuses on developing a RESTful API using Node.js and Express, implementing JWT-based authentication, and testing endpoints with Postman. It also introduces microservices by separating authentication (auth-service.js) and product management (product-service.js) into independent services. The goal is to understand API development, secure user authentication, and the benefits of microservices architecture.
